  "reasoning": "This iteration completely failed to implement any changes despite having a clear design plan. Zero files were modified out of 5 attempted changes, indicating a fundamental disconnect between the design phase and implementation phase. The UI context remains 'unknown' which is likely preventing the specialist agents from locating the correct files to modify. We're stuck in an implementation deadlock where plans are created but nothing executes.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "Having an 'unknown' UI context appears to be blocking implementation - specialist agents can't find files without knowing what component/page they're working on",
    "The orchestration layer is failing to translate design recommendations into actual file changes",
    "Planning without execution context is ineffective - we need to establish what specific UI component or page we're trying to improve",
    "The system may be trying to modify files that don't exist or using incorrect file paths"
  ],
  "suggestedNextSteps": [
    "CRITICAL: Identify and specify the actual UI context - what page/component are we trying to improve? (e.g., 'HomePage', 'LyricsDisplay', 'SearchResults')",
    "Consider a diagnostic run to list available files and components in the project structure",
    "Try targeting a specific, known file directly rather than relying on automatic file discovery",
    "If the UI context cannot be determined, consider starting fresh with a specific, well-defined target component"
