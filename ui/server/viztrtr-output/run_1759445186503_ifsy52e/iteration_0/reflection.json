  "reasoning": "Critical implementation failure detected. Despite having a clear design plan with specific recommendations (improving chord label contrast, lyrics brightness, and line height), ZERO files were actually modified. The implementation system completely failed to make any changes. Additionally, the score mysteriously improved from 5.2 to 5.8 without any actual modifications, suggesting either measurement noise or a fundamental issue with the scoring system. The verification system also incorrectly reported success despite no changes being made. Most concerning is that we don't even know what UI context we're working with (marked as 'unknown').",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "The implementation system is not functioning - it orchestrated 0 file changes despite having clear targets",
    "The UI context is unknown, meaning we don't know which files or components to modify",
    "Score improvements without actual changes indicate measurement variability or scoring system issues",
    "The verification system needs fixing - it reported success (âœ…) for file modifications when 0 files were changed",
    "We cannot trust the current pipeline to make actual UI improvements"
  ],
  "suggestedNextSteps": [
    "URGENT: Identify the actual UI context and target files before attempting any changes",
    "Fix the implementation system to ensure it can actually modify files when given instructions",
    "Implement proper error handling to catch when no files are modified despite attempts",
    "Re-run with explicit file targets rather than relying on automatic file discovery",
    "Consider manually specifying the component files that contain chord labels and lyrics",
    "Add debugging to understand why the specialist agents aren't making changes"
