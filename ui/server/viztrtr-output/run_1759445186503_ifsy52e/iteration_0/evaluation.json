    "accessibility: Touch targets too small - Settings and Upload buttons appear under 44x44px minimum",
    "typography: Inconsistent text sizes for performance context - lyrics should be much larger for 3-10ft viewing distance",
    "visual hierarchy: Chord symbols blend with lyrics - insufficient differentiation between chord names and lyrics",
    "spacing: Cramped vertical spacing between lyric lines for teleprompter use"
