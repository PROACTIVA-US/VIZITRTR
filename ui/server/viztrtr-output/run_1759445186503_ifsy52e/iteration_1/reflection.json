  "reasoning": "This iteration presents a puzzling contradiction - the implementation reports 0 files modified, yet the score improved by +1.0 points. The verification shows 'Files Modified: âœ…' but also states no visual changes occurred. This suggests either: (1) the scoring system has variance/randomness, (2) there's a tracking bug in the implementation system, or (3) changes were made but not properly reported. The design recommendations targeting accessibility and readability for teleprompter viewing seem sensible, but without knowing what actually changed, it's hard to assess their effectiveness. The 'unknown' UI context is also concerning - we're essentially flying blind.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "The implementation tracking system may have reliability issues - showing 0 files modified despite apparent changes",
    "Score improvements without visual changes suggest the scoring mechanism might not be purely visual-based",
    "Working with 'unknown' UI context makes it impossible to verify if we're targeting the right components",
    "The teleprompter-focused improvements (larger text, better contrast) align well with the stated purpose but we can't confirm they were applied"
  ],
  "suggestedNextSteps": [
    "First priority: Identify and target a specific UI context/component rather than working with 'unknown'",
    "Verify the implementation system is actually applying changes by making a dramatic, easily verifiable change",
    "Continue with accessibility improvements but ensure they're being applied to actual UI elements",
    "Consider targeting specific file types or components if the general approach isn't working",
    "Add more aggressive visual changes that would be impossible to miss if properly applied"
