  "reasoning": "This iteration experienced a complete implementation failure. Despite planning 5 changes focused on accessibility (lyric contrast, focus rings) and spacing (vertical rhythm), zero files were actually modified. The system claimed to orchestrate changes across specialist agents but produced no output. With a 37.5% failure rate (9/24 attempts), there's clearly a systemic issue in the implementation pipeline. The score remaining at 5.8/10 is expected given no actual changes were made. Continuing with the same approach would waste iterations.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "The implementation pipeline has a critical failure point between design planning and file modification",
    "Specialist agents are either not executing properly or their output is being lost",
    "Design recommendations (contrast, spacing, focus indicators) sound appropriate but are meaningless without execution",
    "The system needs better error detection - it reported success despite modifying 0 files",
    "High-level orchestration claims don't match low-level file modification reality"
  ],
  "suggestedNextSteps": [
    "Diagnose the implementation pipeline failure before attempting any UI changes",
    "Try a single, simple change to verify the implementation system is functional",
    "Consider switching to a different UI context if the current one has persistent issues",
    "Implement better error checking to catch when 0 files are modified",
    "If implementation continues to fail, consider a manual intervention or system reset"
