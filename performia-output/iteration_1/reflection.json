  "reasoning": "This iteration revealed a critical implementation failure. Despite planning 4 changes targeting typography, accessibility, and visual hierarchy improvements, zero files were actually modified. The score improvement from 4.8 to 5.8 without any actual changes is highly suspicious and likely represents measurement noise or a scoring anomaly. The verification correctly identified no visual changes, confirming that the implementation phase completely failed to execute. This suggests either a technical issue with the implementation agent, incorrect file targeting, or a mismatch between the design plan and the actual codebase structure.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "Implementation can fail silently - we need better error detection when agents fail to modify files",
    "Score changes without file modifications indicate measurement instability or external factors",
    "The design recommendations (responsive fonts, chord contrast, visual separation) appear sound but were never tested",
    "We may be targeting the wrong UI context or files - the system seems to be planning for a music/chord display but may not be finding the correct implementation files"
  ],
  "suggestedNextSteps": [
    "Diagnose why zero files were modified - check if the implementation agent is targeting correct file paths",
    "Verify the UI context is correctly identified - ensure we're targeting existing components",
    "Consider a more aggressive implementation approach with explicit file targets",
    "If the issue persists, switch to a different UI component that we can reliably modify",
    "Add implementation validation to ensure changes are actually applied before proceeding"
