  "reasoning": "This iteration revealed a critical issue: despite having a design plan with 5 attempted changes targeting chord/lyric visualization improvements, ZERO files were actually modified. Yet somehow the score dropped from 7.2 to 4.8. This disconnect between intent and execution, combined with the UI context being listed as 'unknown', suggests we're operating blind. We cannot effectively improve a UI when we don't know what UI component we're targeting. The score drop without any actual changes indicates either a scoring system issue or that we're measuring against the wrong baseline.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "Operating with an 'unknown' UI context leads to wasted iterations - no files were modified despite having specific design recommendations",
    "Score changes without file modifications suggest measurement or baseline issues that need investigation",
    "The system generated chord/lyric-specific recommendations, suggesting it may have some context we're not seeing, but couldn't execute on them",
    "Having 15 total attempts with 4 failures in memory while being on 'iteration 0' indicates possible state management issues"
  ],
  "suggestedNextSteps": [
    "CRITICAL: Identify the actual UI context/component before attempting any changes - we need to know what we're improving",
    "Investigate why the implementation phase resulted in 0 file changes despite having a clear design plan",
    "Verify the scoring system is measuring the correct UI state - a 2.4 point drop with no changes is suspicious",
    "Consider running a diagnostic iteration focused solely on UI discovery and context identification",
    "Once UI context is established, revisit the chord/lyric visualization improvements which seem relevant based on the recommendations"
