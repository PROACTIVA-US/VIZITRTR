## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 🎯 Step 1: Test Dynamic File Discovery
**Goal**: Verify agents can modify files in Performia

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Performia frontend
cd /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Performia
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run VIZTRTR test
cd /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/VIZTRTR
npm run build
npm run test:performia
```

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ "🔍 Discovering component files in: /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Performia"
- ✅ "Found X files" with .tsx/.jsx counts
- ✅ "✅ Modified: src/components/SomeFile.tsx"
- ✅ Actual git diff showing code changes in Performia

**If It Works:**
- Celebrate! 🎉
- Mark Issue #1 as fully resolved in docs
- Move to Step 2

**If It Fails:**
- Check logs for which step failed
- Common issues:
  - Files not discovered → check discovery patterns
  - Files discovered but not chosen → check Claude prompt
  - Files chosen but not modified → check file write logic

### 🎯 Step 2: Merge to Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout feat/backend-server-integration
git merge fix/backend-manager-security-and-reliability
git push
```

### 🎯 Step 3: Address Remaining Issues
From `docs/status/CRITICAL_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md`:

- **Issue #2**: Chrome DevTools integration (hybrid scoring)
- **Issue #3**: Multi-route testing
- **Issue #4**: Enhanced UI change descriptions
- **Issue #5**: PRD validation system

## Quick Commands

### Check Current State
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
git branch -a
```

### Rebuild and Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run test:performia
```

### View Discovery in Action
```bash
# Add this to test script temporarily
cd dist/utils
node -e "const {discoverComponentFiles} = require('./file-discovery'); discoverComponentFiles('/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Performia').then(files => console.log(files))"
```

### Check Performia Changes
```bash
cd /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Performia
git status
git diff
```

## Expected Test Output

### Success Scenario
```
🔧 Backend server enabled, starting...
✅ Backend server ready

🎯 OrchestratorAgent analyzing recommendations...
📋 Routing Plan:
   Strategy: Route to ControlPanelAgent for web UI improvements
   → ControlPanelAgent: 5 items (high priority)

⚡ Executing 1 specialist agents in parallel...

🎛️  ControlPanelAgent processing 5 recommendations...
🔍 Discovering component files in: /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Performia
Found 12 files:
  .tsx: 10 files
  .jsx: 2 files
Total size: 42.15 KB

✅ Modified: src/components/TeleprompterView.tsx
✅ Modified: src/components/ChordDisplay.tsx
📊 Validation: 2/5 passed

Orchestrated 2 file changes across 1 specialist agents
```

### Failure Scenario (What NOT to See)
```
❌ No component files found in /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Performia
Orchestrated 0 file changes across 1 specialist agents
```

## Success Criteria

Before moving to next issue:
- [ ] Test discovers files in Performia
- [ ] At least 1 file is modified
- [ ] Git diff shows real code changes
- [ ] Changes align with recommendations
- [ ] No errors during execution

## Contact Context

**Project**: VIZTRTR - Autonomous UI/UX Improvement System
**Location**: `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/VIZTRTR`
**Target Project**: Performia (Teleprompter app)
**Target Location**: `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Performia`

**Current Focus**: Making the implementation system actually work (Issue #1 from CRITICAL_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md)

## Notes for Claude

When resuming:
1. Read this file first for quick context
2. Check `docs/status/SESSION_2025_10_03_DYNAMIC_DISCOVERY.md` for full details
3. Verify branch is `fix/backend-manager-security-and-reliability`
4. Start with testing as outlined in Step 1 above
5. If test succeeds, celebrate and document results
6. If test fails, debug systematically (discovery → selection → modification)

**Philosophy**: We chose Option A (dynamic discovery) over Option C (direct implementation) because the multi-agent architecture is more scalable and maintainable long-term, even though it's more complex.
